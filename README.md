Crypto Paper Trader
===================

Crypto Paper Trader is a set of applications developed by Michael Schwartz that are designed to help day traders and scalpers become more consistent traders through paper trading (aka simulated trading) using real market data before actually trading with real money. This way they can get an idea of how trading in the market actually is without the risk of losing real money.
